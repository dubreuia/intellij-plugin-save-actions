# Intellij Save Actions Plugin

Supports configurable, Eclipse like, save actions, including "organize imports", "reformat code", "rearrange code", "compile file" and some quick fixes like "add / remove 'this' qualifier", etc. The plugin executes the configured actions when the file is synchronised (or saved) on disk.

## Features

### Code formatting

- Organize imports
- Reformat code (only changed text or all)
- Rearrange code (reorder methods, fields, etc.)

### Build

- Compile file

### Quick fixes

- Add final to local variable
- Add final to field
- Remove explicit generic type for diamond
- Qualify field access with this
- Remove unused suppress warning annotation
- Remove final from private method
- Remove unnecessary semicolon
- Add missing @Override annotations
- Use blocks in if/while/for statements

### Other

- File inclusion / exclusion with regex support
- Works on any file type Intellij IDEA can reformat (Java, XML, etc.)
- Simple option page to activate / deactivate actions

## Compatibility

It works in Intellij IDEA Community Edition build 135+, and is not expected to work in other products. See issue [#18](https://github.com/dubreuia/intellij-plugin-save-actions/issues/18) for a beta packaging that works in all products.

## Installation

Install it from the plugin repository in Intellij IDEA (**recommended**):

- "File > Settings > Plugins > Browse repositories... > Search 'Save Actions' > Category 'Code tools'"

Or the plugin is available from the [Intellij IDEA Community Edition plugin repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7642) and you can also download the jar from there then add it in Intellij IDEA:

- "File > Settings > Plugins > Install plugin from disk..."

## Configuration

The configurations are located in "File > Settings > Other Settings > Save Actions".

| Name                         | Description
| ---                          | ---
| Activate save actions        | Enable / disable the plugin
| No action if compile errors  | Enable / disable no action if there are compile errors. Applied to each file individually
| Organize imports             | Enable / disable import organization (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Imports")
| Reformat file                | Enable / disable formatting (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style"). See "Reformat only changed code" for more options
| Rearrange fields and methods | Enable / disable re-ordering of fields and methods (configured in "File > Settings > Code Style > Java > Arrangement")
| Reformat only changed code   | Enable / disable formatting for changed code only. If VCS is configured, it is used to check which lines where modified. If VCS is not configured, the code will always get reformatted
| Compile file                 | Enable / disable compiling of the modified file. The compiler might compile other files as well
| File path inclusions         | Add / remove file path inclusions (by default, everything included). The Java regular expressions match the whole file name from the project root. Include only Java files: `.*\.java`. 
| File path exclusions         | Add / remove file path exclusions to ignore files (overrides inclusions). The Java regular expressions match the whole file name from the project root. Exclude 'Main.java' only in root folder: `Main\.java`. Exclude file 'Foo.java' only in folder 'src': `src/Foo\.java`. Exclude all xml files in any folder: `.*/.*\.xml`

## Java quick fixes

| Name                                      | Description
| ---                                       | ---
| Add final to local variable               | Will add the final modifier to any local variable (not parameters or fields)
| Add final to field                        | Will add the final modifier to any class fields (not parameters or local variables)
| Remove explicit generic type for diamond  | Will remove unused right side generic types for Java 7 diamond operator. This `List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>()` becomes `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>()`
| Qualify field access with this            | Will qualify all field access with this
| Remove unused suppress warning annotation | Will remove any unused @SuppressWarning annotations
| Remove final from private method          | Will remove final for private method
| Remove unnecessary semicolon              | Will remove unnecessary semicolon
| Add missing @Override annotations         | Will add missing @Override annotations to all inherited methods
| Use blocks in if/while/for statements     | Will add missing braces to any if, while or for statements without braces

## Files location

- **idea.log**: The log file the save actions plugin writes in. It contains debug information, prefixed with `com.dubreuia.SaveActionManager`. If you are using default locations, it would be in `~/.IntelliJIdeaVERSION/system/log/idea.log`.
- **saveactions_settings.xml**: The settings file is saved by project in the `.idea` folder. That file can be commited in git thus shared in your development team. If you are using the default locations, it would be in `~/IdeaProjects/PROJECT_NAME/.idea/saveactions_settings.xml`
