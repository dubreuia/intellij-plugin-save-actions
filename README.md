# Intellij Save Actions Plugin

Supports configurable, Eclipse like, save actions, including "organize imports", "reformat code", "rearrange code", "compile file" and some quick fixes like "add / remove 'this' qualifier", etc. The plugin executes the configured actions when the file is synchronised (or saved) on disk.

## Features

### Code formatting

- Organize imports
- Reformat code (only changed text or all)
- Rearrange code (reorder methods, fields, etc.)

### Build

- Compile file

### Quick fixes

- Add final to local variable
- Add final to field
- Remove explicit generic type for diamond
- Qualify field access with this
- Remove unused suppress warning annotation
- Remove final from private method
- Remove unnecessary semicolon
- Add missing @Override annotations

### Other

- File inclusion/exclusion with regex support
- Works on any file type Intellij IDEA can reformat (Java, XML, etc.)
- Simple option page to activate / deactivate actions

## Compatibility

A pattern that do not compile cannot be added to the list. Exclude 'Main.java' only in root folder: `Main\.java`. Exclude file 'Foo.java' only in folder 'src': `src/Foo\.java`.

| Remove explicit generic type for diamond  | Will remove unused right side generic types for Java 7 diamond operator. This `List<String> list = new ArrayList<String>()` becomes `List<String> list = new ArrayList<>()`
| Qualify field access with this            | Will qualify all field access with this
| Remove unused suppress warning annotation | Will remove any unused @SuppressWarning annotations
